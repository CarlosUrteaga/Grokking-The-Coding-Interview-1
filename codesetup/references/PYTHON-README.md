# Steps to run example codebase in <img src="https://cdn.svgporn.com/logos/python.svg" height="50"/> 

> The python implementation of a particular problem is written such that the code can be freely tested amongst numerous test cases.

The python implementation is structured in the following order:

```
MainApp
├───app
│   ├───__init__.py
│   └───mainApp.py
└───testMainApp.py
```

## `app`

The directory contains the main code under `mainApp.py` for the problem statement.

A sample `mainApp.py` has been provided. It should look somewhat like this.

```python
# mainApp.py

class MainApp:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    ''' Problem Statement goes here...
    '''

    def run(self, arr, k):
        ''' 
        code goes here
        '''

        return 0
```

You can insert your code within `run()`.
